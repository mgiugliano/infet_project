These two tables represent a working document to help intersectorial research involving Neuroscientists, Electrochemists and Electronic Engineers. It aims at facilitating the creation of connections between concepts, models, definitions related to the description of electron devices and circuits in the field of microelectronics with corresponding entities in the field of electrochemistry and neuroscience. The connections do not necessarily entail a strict correspondence or equality in the definitions. They hint at similarities which also emphasize differences useful to stimulate deepening the knowledge.
The document is open to contributions by different cathegories of stakeholders; sort of an intersectorial Wikipedia. It is by no means complete and wishes to stimulate other researchers and scholars in the field to contribute enriching it. 
If deemed useful for the intended purposes, the table can be structured in sections and ordered, enriched with hyperlinks to references, etc.
