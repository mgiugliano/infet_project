| Maximum carrier density       | Defined by the charge: density of states and occupation probability (equilibrium: Fermi-Dirac distribution + Poisson)            |  | Defined by the size of the ions/molecules (at equiliubrium: modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation) |                      |
| Mass transport                | Negligible due to relatively high mobility of electrons and holes                                                                |  | Important, since ions can be slow and in very low concentrations                                 |                      |
| Interactions between carriers | One electron only interacts with one hole and viceversa (except in rare multiparticle scattering events, e.g. impact ionization) |  | Multiple stoichiometries are possible, leading to new chemical species                           |                      |
| Interfaces                    | Surface recombination velocity; carrier tunneling across barrier                                                                 |  | Surface reactions or adsorption can occur                                                        |                      |
