L. J. Mele, P. Palestri, and L. Selmi, “General model and equivalent circuit for the chemical noise spectrum associated to surface charge fluctuation in potentiometric sensors,” IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 21, no. 5, pp. 6258-6269, March 2021. DOI: 10.1109/JSEN.2020.3038036.

This paper was published thanks to the partial support of the Italian Ministero dell’istruzione, dell’università e della ricerca [Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)] by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (IN-FET Project) via the Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per la Nanoelettronica (IU.NET) Consortium under Grant 862882.

Specifically, the code:
i) shows an example of implementation of matrices when considering site-binding surface reactions;
ii) reproduces the calculation of the surface charge density noise PSD, reported in the manuscript Fig. 3; 
iii) prints the equivalent total surface admittance (Eq. 30) as an s-polynomial function, for the case pH=7.

The aim is to provide people reading the manuscript an input demo code that can be used for a better understading of the our model and for personal model implementation and extensions.
